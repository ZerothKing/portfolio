Senior Software Development Engineer
July 2023 – Present
• BTM (Better Timestamp Management): Implemented firm-wide project standardizing timestamp
serialization/deserialization across all APIs, databases, and external client integrations. Drove internal and external
adoption across internal applications and external SDKs. Exposed multiple dashboards using Datadog and ELK to
showcase observability of the adoption. Conducted training sessions/office hours for BTM adoption
• Configuration Management System: Architected synchronous configuration update system for all applications
for BTM with periodic caching. Built Apache Airflow batch jobs with DAGs for periodic AWS S3 uploads and
added monitoring/health endpoints per application, eliminating operational overhead
• BigDecimal SDK Enhancement: Authored RFC and implemented BigDecimal support across Java, Python,
and C# SDKs, solving arbitrary precision requirements for C# where native support was insufficient
• Rate Limiter Library: Contributed to rate limiter design within a monolith application, decoupling Hazelcast
dependencies. Designed resilient algorithms considering pod size and count for better client distribution to ensure
smooth consumption of tokens
• Security & Vulnerability Management: Led InfoSec initiatives fixing vulnerable JARs, Jackson deserialization
defects, and path traversal attacks. Integrated automated security scans in CI/CD pipelines
• CI/CD & Process Enhancement: Improved GitLab pipelines across multiple repositories, added parallelization
and established hotfix procedures with regression testing, and optimized gradle builds for quicker build and test
time. Wrote multiple custom gradle tasks as per application requirements.
• SDK Maintenance & Technical Expertise: Served as SME/Maintainer for SDK development, reviewing all
merge requests. Maintained internal tool ’Frames’ for RESTful API exposure and internal application
communication. Exposed ’Frames’ as open source within the firm and acted as the maintainer. Handled the release
process for external SDK and internal Frames and set guidelines for proper contributions
• Client Support & Incident Resolution: Resolved multiple client-facing issues and participated in critical
incident response, ensuring system stability and customer satisfaction. Participated in regular Ops cycle to debug
critical issues within SLOs
• LLM, New Tech Innovation & Developer Productivity: Pioneered adoption of emerging technologies like
WSL, authored comprehensive onboarding wikis and automation scripts. Evaluated and integrated LLM tools with
performance testing, established prompt engineering repository and memory bank for ’Frames’ repository
